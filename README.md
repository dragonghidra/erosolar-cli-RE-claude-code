# apt-cli-RE-claude-code

APT (formerly Erosolar) now ships as `apt` with config/state under `~/.apt` (legacy `~/.erosolar` is still honored). The CLI also includes a penetration-testing suite (nmap/nuclei/ffuf/gobuster) for defensive baselines and red-team recon—enable the `Penetration testing` tool option via `/tools` to use it.

This RE, after manually implementation the correct strategy, is incredibly boring because 100% of edits work properly afterwards, achieving full Claude Code parity in a modular way with minimal human intervention needed.

# For agentic orchestration offense beats defense entirely so this is entirely hilarious for me; I’m open sourcing this version but using genai to generate agents to run for any task as the product

At this point, it's actually incredibly boring to manage, and could 100% easily, so easily, be done fully autonomously with AI.

So boring...
